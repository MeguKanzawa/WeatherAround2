# Concept

A weather map web page that allows the user to find the weather around them in real time. 
Since most weather applications seemed cluttered with either too much information/too less information, I wanted to make an app that was intuitive and fun to interact with. 
1. By clicking on the ![map-pin](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3eb78cac-08b1-454d-9930-81db57bcda9c)
user can look into the location they want around them to investigate what the weather is. 
2. You are able to scroll through the ones you have clicked on in the Weather Panel.
3. If you want to look more closely into the weather of a specific location, click on the Favorite Button ![heart-plus](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c71288c-265b-4783-9c28-007b4754ada3)
This will give you a more detailed hourly view of the weather for that location. 

# Technologies Used

The app used ReactJS by incorporating the component based architecture fully: using states, ref, effects, each of the components are separately rendered. 
Tooltips have been added to guide the user through the app first. More details in the web app Technologies Section.


# Installations

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
